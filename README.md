## Description

![Lifting Tracker](./public/assets/image/Screenshot.png)

This is a full stack project written and developed by Yoon-Jae Kim, Brian Klein, and Logan Rehberg. Parts of the code here were lifted from the Mini-Project of Module 14 of the NW Coding Bootcamp. We also used code from these two sources to add a Handlebar Helper function and an Elevator model, respectively.

https://github.com/tholman/elevator.js

The purpose of this was project is to solidfy the MVC model concept by having us create a fully functional website from scratch. The website is a simple workout tracker that allows users to login, sign up, post their workouts, and add exercises to said workouts

The Models for this project boil down to three separate tables, Users, Workouts, and Exercises. The Views are handled by Handlebar and pull Models via the Controller, handled by Express.

Users will login, add workout from the profile page, then edit their workout by adding or deleting exercises from the workout. Exercises are tied to each user's workout and users cannot edit other users' creations.

The length of the page can get pretty lengthy, so we used the elevator model from @tholman to enable the user to scroll back up to the top of the page in a fun way. It plays catchy muzak as well!
